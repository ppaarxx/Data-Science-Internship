# Data Science Internship

## Overview

During this internship, various machine learning algorithms were applied to different datasets using the `sklearn` library. The goal was to explore and evaluate the performance of several algorithms for classification tasks.

## Datasets

The following datasets are included in this repository:

- **Census Income**: [Dataset](dataset1.zip)
- **Walmart Recruiting Store Sales Forecasting**: [Dataset](walmart-recruiting-store-sales-forecasting)
- **What's Cooking**: [Dataset](whats-cooking)
- **Iris**: [Dataset](IRIS.csv)
- **Housing**: [Dataset](housing.csv)
- **Titanic**: [Dataset](titanic.csv)
- **Wine Quality**: [Dataset](winequalityN.csv)

## Algorithms Applied

Various machine learning algorithms were applied to the datasets:

- **Random Forest Classifier**
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
- **Gradient Boosting Classifier**
- **Naive Bayes**
- **Neural Network**
- **Decision Tree Classifier**
